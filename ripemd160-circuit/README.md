## RIPEMD160 Circuit(Halo2)
  * ZKP/WEB3 Hackthon Project  
  * zk-Circuits Track - Category 4 (Circuit development in Halo2-ce)


### Description
 The goal of project is to implement and improve the ZK circuit of RIPEMD160 hashing function using [Halo2-ce](https://github.com/halo2-ce/halo2).  
 This repo includes the implementation of RIPEMD160 hashing circuit.


### Techniques
 The project needs the skills of ZKP circuit research and development, Halo2-ce library, and Rustlang.


### How I approached the problem
  - Read the cryptography paper of RIPEMD160-hash function
  - Implement the function myself
  - Develop the ZK circuit using Halo2-ce
  - Improve the circuit (like shrinking columns of circuit)
